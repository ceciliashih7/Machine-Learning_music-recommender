This is a machine learning project that uses a decision tree classifier to classify music genres based on various features such as tempo, loudness, and other audio characteristics. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.

The goal of this project is to classify music genres using a dataset (music.csv) and train a machine learning model using a decision tree classifier. The model is trained and tested on a dataset that contains audio features, and the performance is evaluated based on accuracy.

Technologies Used: Python,Pandas, scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook

Results
1.Trained a DecisionTreeClassifier to predict music genres.
2.Preprocessed the dataset by separating features and target labels.
3.Evaluated the model's performance using accuracy metrics.
